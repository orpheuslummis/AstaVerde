# AstaVerde Phase 2 - QA Testing Guide & Checklist

Welcome! This comprehensive guide will help you test the new EcoStabilizer vault system on the Base Sepolia testnet.

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Setup MetaMask Wallet

1. Install MetaMask browser extension from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)
2. Create or import a wallet
3. **Add Base Sepolia Network** - Click "Add Network" and use these settings:
   - Network Name: `Base Sepolia`
   - RPC URL: `https://sepolia.base.org`
   - Chain ID: `84532`
   - Currency Symbol: `ETH`
   - Explorer: `https://sepolia.basescan.org`

### 2. Get Test Funds

You'll need test ETH for transactions and test USDC for purchases:

1. **Get Test ETH** (for gas fees):
   - Visit: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia
   - Enter your wallet address
   - Receive 0.1 ETH (enough for many transactions)

2. **Get Test USDC** (optional, for buying NFTs):
   - Will be provided separately if needed for testing
   - Contact support if you need test USDC

### 3. Access the Test App

üåê **Test URL**: [To be provided after deployment]

Connect your wallet when prompted. Make sure you're on Base Sepolia network!

## üìã What You're Testing

The **EcoStabilizer Vault** allows users to:
- **Deposit** carbon offset NFTs to receive 20 SCC tokens (loan)
- **Withdraw** their exact NFT by repaying 20 SCC tokens

Think of it like a pawn shop for NFTs - you get an instant loan and can always get your exact item back.

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Deposit ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Deposit an NFT and receive SCC tokens

1. Go to "My Tokens" page
2. Find an NFT you own that shows "Deposit" button
3. Click "Deposit"
4. Approve the transaction in MetaMask (2 transactions: approval + deposit)
5. **Expected Result**: 
   - NFT shows "In Vault" status
   - Your SCC balance increases by 20
   - "Withdraw" button appears

### Scenario 2: Basic Withdrawal ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Get your NFT back from the vault

1. Make sure you have at least 20 SCC tokens
2. Find your vaulted NFT (shows "Withdraw" button)
3. Click "Withdraw"
4. Approve the transaction in MetaMask (may be 2 transactions)
5. **Expected Result**:
   - NFT returns to your wallet
   - 20 SCC deducted from balance
   - "Deposit" button reappears

### Scenario 3: Redeemed NFT Protection ‚ùå

**Goal**: Verify redeemed NFTs cannot be deposited

1. Find an NFT marked as "Redeemed"
2. Check that NO deposit button appears
3. **Expected Result**: Redeemed NFTs should not have vault options

### Scenario 4: Insufficient SCC ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Goal**: Test withdrawal with insufficient funds

1. Ensure you have less than 20 SCC
2. Try to withdraw a vaulted NFT
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - Button shows "Need 20 SCC" or similar
   - Transaction should not proceed
