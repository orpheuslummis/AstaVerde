# AstaVerde V2 - Comprehensive QA Testing Plan

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-31  
**Contracts:** AstaVerde.sol, EcoStabilizer.sol, StabilizedCarbonCoin.sol

This comprehensive testing plan covers both the Phase 1 marketplace and Phase 2 EcoStabilizer vault system for the Sepolia testnet deployment (currently Arbitrum Sepolia).

Notes:

- Local QA runs the webapp via `npm run dev:sepolia` (port 3002).
- Webapp configuration uses a single untracked `webapp/.env.local` (copy from `webapp/.env.local.example`).

## Critical user flows (webapp)

These flows test the most important contract interactions via the webapp UI:

### Flow 1: Complete NFT Lifecycle

**Path**: Home → Purchase → My Tokens → Vault → Withdraw

1. **Purchase**: Home page → Click batch → Buy NFT → Confirm in MetaMask
2. **View**: My Tokens page → Verify NFT appears with correct metadata
3. **Deposit**: Click "Deposit to Vault" → Approve → Deposit → Verify +20 SCC
4. **Withdraw**: Click "Withdraw" → Approve SCC → Withdraw → Verify -20 SCC
5. **Verify**: NFT back in wallet, all status updates correct

### Flow 2: Redemption protection

**Path**: My Tokens → Redeem → Attempt Vault

1. **Own NFT**: Have unredeemed NFT in My Tokens
2. **Redeem**: Click "Redeem" button → Confirm transaction
3. **Verify Badge**: NFT shows "Redeemed" status
4. **No Vault**: Confirm NO "Deposit to Vault" button appears
5. **Contract check**: Direct contract call should revert with "redeemed asset"

### Flow 3: Bulk vault operations

**Path**: My Tokens → Select Multiple → Bulk Actions

1. **Own Multiple**: Have 5+ unredeemed NFTs from same batch
2. **Bulk Deposit**: Click "Deposit All" on batch group
3. **Verify SCC**: Balance increases by (count × 20)
4. **Withdraw**: Use the single-token "Withdraw" button on each vaulted NFT (no bulk withdraw UI)
5. Optional: Test contract-level `withdrawBatch(tokenIds)` via explorer or script

### Flow 4: Producer Revenue Claim

**Path**: Producer Page → View Balance → Claim

1. **Login as Producer**: Use producer wallet account
2. **Navigate**: Go to `/producer` page
3. **Check Balance**: View accumulated producer balance
4. **Claim Funds**: Click "Claim" → Confirm transaction
5. **Verify**: USDC transferred to wallet

### Flow 5: Admin Price Management

**Path**: Admin → Pricing → Adjust Parameters

1. **Login as Admin**: Use admin/owner account
2. **View Current**: Check current base price, floor, thresholds
3. **Adjust Base**: Change base price within bounds (40-200)
4. **Monitor Events**: Check for BasePriceAdjusted event

2. **Check Status**: View paused state for AstaVerde
3. **Pause Marketplace**: Click pause button for AstaVerde contract
4. **Verify**: No purchases allowed, existing NFTs still visible
5. **Pause Vault**: Use Arbiscan (or a script) to call `pause()` on `EcoStabilizer` (no current UI control)
6. **Verify**: No deposits/withdrawals, but SCC transfers still work
7. **Unpause**: Resume operations (unpause marketplace in UI; unpause vault via explorer) and verify functionality restored

### Flow 7: Batch Redemption

**Path**: My Tokens → Select Multiple → Redeem Selected

1. **Own Multiple**: Have 10+ unredeemed NFTs
2. **Select Tokens**: Use checkboxes to select multiple NFTs
3. **Click Redeem**: "Redeem Selected" button with count
4. **Progress Bar**: Shows "Redeeming X of Y..."
5. **Batch Processing**: Automatic batching if >50 tokens
6. **Verify**: All selected tokens show "Redeemed" badge
7. **Vault Check**: Redeemed tokens have no deposit option

### Flow 8: USDC Surplus Recovery

**Path**: Admin → Gas Optimization → Recover Surplus

1. **Check Surplus**: View estimated recoverable amount
2. **Enter Address**: Input recipient address for recovery

2. **Navigate to Mint**: Admin page → Mint tab
3. **Enter Producers**: Add up to 50 producer addresses
4. **Enter CIDs**: Add corresponding IPFS content hashes
5. **Execute Mint**: Click "Mint Batch" → Confirm gas
6. **Verify Creation**: New batch appears on Home page
7. **Check Metadata**: Token details show correct producer/CID

### Flow 11: Failed Transaction Recovery

**Path**: Any transaction → Error → Retry

6. **New Deposit**: New owner can deposit if unredeemed

### Flow 13: Approval management

**Path**: Various pages → Approval states

1. **USDC approval**: First purchase auto-prompts approval; UI uses a buffered amount
2. **Allowance**: No in-app allowance UI; use wallet/explorer to view or revoke
3. **NFT approval**: Vault deposit requires `setApprovalForAll` (auto-prompted when needed)
4. **SCC approval**: First withdrawal requires SCC approval (auto-prompted)
5. **Infinite approval**: Optional via wallet/explorer if desired
6. **Revoke**: Set allowance to 0 via wallet/explorer if needed
7. **Gas**: Subsequent operations skip re-approval

### Flow 14: Concurrent Operations Protection

## Testing best practices

### Test Execution Order

1. **Setup & Access**: Verify wallet connection and network
2. **Happy Path**: Test all success scenarios first
3. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions
4. **Error Cases**: Verify all failure modes
5. **Security Tests**: Attempt unauthorized actions
6. **Performance**: Measure gas and load times

### Testing Tools & Techniques

- **Browser DevTools**: Monitor network requests and console errors
- **Explorer (Arbiscan)**: Verify contract interactions
- **Gas Profiler**: Track actual vs estimated gas
- **Multiple Wallets**: Test with MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase
- **Time Manipulation**: Use test environment time controls for auction testing

### Data Collection

- Screenshot all errors with console open
- Record transaction hashes for all operations
- Note exact gas used vs estimates
- Document response times for each action
- Track any unexpected behaviors

## Contract coverage verification

### Critical Contract Functions Tested via Webapp UI:

#### AstaVerde.sol coverage

- ✅ **buyBatch()** → Home page "Buy" button on batch cards
- ✅ **redeemToken()** → My Tokens "Redeem" button
- ✅ **claimProducerFunds()** → Producer page "Claim" button
- ✅ **getCurrentBatchPrice()** → Price display on batch cards
- ✅ **getTokenProducer()** → Token details page shows producer
- ✅ **getTokenCid()** → IPFS metadata displayed
- ✅ **isRedeemed()** → "Redeemed" badge on tokens

#### EcoStabilizer.sol coverage

- ✅ **deposit()** → My Tokens "Deposit to Vault" button
- ✅ **depositBatch()** → "Deposit All" batch action
- ✅ **withdraw()** → "Withdraw" button on vaulted tokens
- (UI) **withdraw** only (bulk withdraw not available in UI)
- ✅ **loans()** → Vault status display on token cards
- ✅ **getUserLoanIds()** → "In Vault" tab filtering

#### StabilizedCarbonCoin.sol coverage

- ✅ **balanceOf()** → SCC balance in header
- ✅ **approve()** → Automatic during withdraw flow
- ✅ **mint()** → Triggered by vault deposits (20 SCC per NFT)
- ✅ **burn()** → Triggered by vault withdrawals

### Critical Security Paths Tested:

1. **Redemption Protection**: UI prevents depositing redeemed NFTs
2. **Access Control**: Producer/Admin pages restricted by role
3. **Balance Verification**: SCC balance always matches contract state
4. **Gas Limits**: All operations stay within target gas usage
5. **Error Handling**: Contract reverts show clear user messages
