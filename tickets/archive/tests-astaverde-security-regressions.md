# Ticket: Add Security Regression Tests for AstaVerde

- Component: `test/`
- Severity: High (Prevents Regressions)
- Type: Testing
- **Status: ✅ COMPLETED** (2025-08-13)
- **Implementation**: test/SecurityRegressions.ts

## Background / Justification

Two critical logic issues were identified and will be fixed: (1) overpayment refund siphon, (2) price underflow. We need explicit tests to prevent future regressions.

## Tasks

1. Overpay Siphon Test:
    - Seed contract with funds via a normal purchase.
    - Attempt `buyBatch` with over-declared payment; assert no extra refund is paid out beyond actual transferred funds.
2. Price Underflow Test:
    - Create a batch and advance time far beyond `startingPrice/dailyPriceDecay` days.
    - Assert `getCurrentBatchPrice` returns `priceFloor` without revert.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tests fail with the current vulnerable logic and pass after the fixes.
- Coverage reflects both negative and positive paths.

## Affected Files

- `test/AstaVerde.logic.behavior.ts` (extend)

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
