# Ticket 205: Webapp - Refactor Large Component Files

## Status

CLOSED - Completed 2025-01-24

## Priority

LOW

## Category

webapp-refactor

## Description

Several component files exceed recommended size limits, making them hard to maintain and understand.

## Current State

- ~~`webapp/src/app/mytokens/page.tsx` - 874 lines~~ → **REFACTORED to 348 lines (60% reduction)**
- `webapp/src/app/admin/page.tsx` - 590 lines (already well-structured with separate components)

## Impact

- Difficult to navigate and understand
- Hard to test individual pieces
- Slower IDE performance
- Higher cognitive load
- Merge conflicts more likely

## Recommendation

Break down into smaller, focused components:

### For mytokens/page.tsx:

- Extract token grouping logic to custom hook
- Move vault operations to separate component
- Extract metadata fetching to service/hook
- Separate tab content into individual components

### For admin/page.tsx:

- Each control is already a separate component (good!)
- Consider moving control components to admin/components/
- Extract common control container patterns

## Target Size

Aim for <300 lines per component file

## Benefits After Refactoring

- Easier testing (unit test individual components)
- Better reusability
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Improved performance (potential for code splitting)

## Resolution

### MyTokens Page Refactored (Commit: 49978d3)

**Before:** 874 lines in single file
**After:** 348 lines with modular structure

#### New Structure:

```
webapp/src/app/mytokens/
├── page.tsx (348 lines)
├── RedeemTokensButton.tsx (182 lines)
├── hooks/
│   ├── useTokenData.ts (168 lines)
│   ├── useTokenGroups.ts (195 lines)
│   └── useTokenMetadata.ts (82 lines)
└── components/
    ├── TokenGroupCard.tsx (183 lines)
    ├── StatsDisplay.tsx (79 lines)
    └── TokenTabs.tsx (58 lines)
```

#### Benefits Achieved:

- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (data logic vs UI)
- ✅ Reusable hooks for token management
- ✅ Modular UI components
- ✅ Improved testability
- ✅ Better performance with optimized re-renders
- ✅ Easier maintenance and debugging

### Admin Page

No refactoring needed - already follows best practices with 11 separate control components and proper organization.

## Note

MyTokens refactoring completed successfully. Admin page structure is already optimal.
