# CRITICAL SECURITY STATUS - January 2025

**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Phase**: Pre-Mainnet Deployment  
**Risk Level**: ‚úÖ FIXED - All Critical Issues Resolved

## Executive Summary

**UPDATE**: All 3 critical vulnerabilities have been successfully fixed on 2025-08-13. The AstaVerde protocol is now secure and ready for final testing before mainnet deployment.

## ‚úÖ FIXED VULNERABILITIES (All Resolved)

### 1. ‚úÖ Overpayment Refund Siphon Attack - FIXED

- **File**: `contracts/AstaVerde.sol` line 228
- **Status**: FIXED - Removed `usdcAmount` parameter entirely
- **Fix Applied**: `buyBatch` now only accepts `(batchID, tokenAmount)` and pulls exact cost
- **Impact**: Complete prevention of fund drainage attacks
- **Test Coverage**: `test/SecurityFixes.ts` - comprehensive tests added

### 2. ‚úÖ Redeemed NFT Resale - FIXED

- **File**: `contracts/AstaVerde.sol` line 361
- **Status**: FIXED - Added redemption check in token selection
- **Fix Applied**: `getPartialIds` now checks `&& !tokens[tokenId].redeemed`
- **Impact**: Redeemed NFTs cannot be resold to unsuspecting buyers
- **Test Coverage**: `test/SecurityFixes.ts` - edge cases tested

### 3. ‚úÖ Vault Collateral Trapped During Pause - FIXED

- **File**: `contracts/AstaVerde.sol` lines 32, 114-117, 119-138
- **Status**: FIXED - Added trusted vault allowlist
- **Fix Applied**: Added `trustedVault` address and modified `_update` to allow vault transfers during pause
- **Impact**: Users can withdraw collateral even during emergency pause
- **Test Coverage**: `test/SecurityFixes.ts` - pause scenarios tested

## ‚úÖ RESOLVED ISSUES

### 1. SCC Role Governance

- **Status**: FIXED - Admin role renounced in deployment script
- **File**: `deploy/deploy_ecostabilizer.ts` lines 63-64
- **Archived**: `tickets/archive/fix-scc-role-governance-hardening.md`

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (Post-Launch)

1. **Slippage Protection** - Add maxPrice and deadline to buyBatch
2. **Event Ordering** - Emit events after state changes
3. **Price Underflow** - Check for arithmetic underflows
4. **Zero Address Producer** - Validate producer addresses

## üìä Risk Assessment

| Component               | Risk Level  | Exploitable | Fund Loss Risk |
