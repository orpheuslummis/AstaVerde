| Security issues | Very Low | Critical | Comprehensive testing done |

---

## ‚úÖ SIGN-OFF CHECKLIST

- [x] Smart contracts reviewed
- [x] Security analysis complete
- [x] Test coverage verified
- [x] Gas optimization checked
- [x] Deployment scripts validated
- [ ] **buyBatch issue fixed**
- [ ] **Error handling added**
- [ ] Final QA pass

---

## üí° FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**MERGE AFTER FIXES:** The implementation is solid and production-ready once the two blockers are resolved. The smart contracts are particularly well-done with excellent security and testing. Fix the critical issues (estimated 1 hour total), then proceed with confidence.

**Quality Score: 8.5/10** (will be 9.5/10 after fixes)
