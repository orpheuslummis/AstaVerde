# Ticket 109: SUMMARY - External Security Audit Findings Tracker

## Status: TRACKING

## Date: 2025-08-24

## Source: External Security Review

## Overview

This ticket tracks all findings from the external security audit of AstaVerde contracts. Individual findings have been filed as separate tickets where not already tracked.

## Critical Findings (Must Fix Before Mainnet)

### ✅ Tracked Issues

1. **#107 - Price Decrease Bypass** (NEW - CRITICAL)
    - Single token purchase prevents price decreases
    - Economic manipulation vulnerability
    - **Status**: OPEN - Requires immediate fix

2. **#103 - SCC Role Management** (EXISTING - CRITICAL)
    - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE must be renounced properly
    - Can brick system if done incorrectly
    - **Status**: OPEN - Requires deployment procedure

## Medium Severity Findings

### ✅ Tracked Issues

1. **#108 - USDC Fee-on-Transfer** (NEW - MEDIUM)
    - No balance delta verification
    - Could break accounting with non-canonical tokens
    - **Status**: OPEN - Should fix for testnet

2. **#104 - Price Update Gas DoS** (EXISTING - MEDIUM)
    - Already tracked and partially mitigated
    - maxPriceUpdateIterations implemented
    - **Status**: OPEN - Monitor post-deployment

### ✅ Acceptable/Documented

1. **Admin Sweep Function** (EcoStabilizer)
    - Properly restricted, necessary feature
    - Cannot sweep active loans
    - **Status**: ACCEPTABLE - Keep as-is

## Low Severity Findings

### ✅ All Acceptable

1. **Remainder Distribution**: First producer gets <1 USDC remainder - minimal impact
2. **Timestamp Manipulation**: 15s drift negligible for daily boundaries
3. **Parameter Centralization**: Mitigated by multisig requirement

## Positive Security Features Confirmed

✅ **Well Implemented**:

- Reentrancy protection (nonReentrant modifier)
- CEI pattern throughout
- Pull payments for producers
- Supply cap enforcement (1B SCC)
- Redemption status checks
- Pausable mechanisms
- Access control patterns

## Action Priority

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Block Mainnet

1. **Fix #107**: Implement 95% threshold for price decrease eligibility
2. **Document #103**: Create foolproof deployment script with role management

### 🟡 HIGH - Should Fix

1. **Fix #108**: Add balance verification for testnet deployments
2. **Test #107**: Add manipulation attack test cases

### 🟢 MEDIUM - Monitor

1. **Watch #104**: Monitor PriceUpdateIterationLimitReached events
2. **Multisig**: Ensure deployment with proper multisig

## Test Coverage Gaps

- ❌ Missing: Price manipulation attack test (single token purchase)
- ❌ Missing: Fee-on-transfer token test
- ✅ Covered: Reentrancy, roles, boundaries, direct transfers

## Deployment Checklist

```bash
# Pre-deployment
[ ] Fix #107 - Price decrease bypass
[ ] Fix #108 - USDC balance check (testnet)
[ ] Setup multisig wallets

# Deployment sequence
[ ] Deploy StabilizedCarbonCoin
[ ] Deploy EcoStabilizer with SCC address
[ ] Grant MINTER_ROLE to EcoStabilizer
[ ] ⚠️ CRITICAL: Renounce DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE on SCC
[ ] Verify roles on-chain
[ ] Transfer ownership to multisig

# Post-deployment
[ ] Monitor price adjustment events
[ ] Verify no additional MINTER_ROLE grants
[ ] Document operations performed
```

## Related Tickets

- #103: SCC deployment role management (CRITICAL)
- #104: Price iteration DoS (MEDIUM)
- #107: Price decrease bypass (CRITICAL - NEW)
- #108: USDC fee-on-transfer (MEDIUM - NEW)

## Recommendation

**DO NOT DEPLOY TO MAINNET** until:

1. Ticket #107 (price manipulation) is fixed and tested
2. Ticket #103 deployment procedure is bulletproof
3. Ticket #108 protection is added for testnet

## Audit Details

- **Review Date**: 2025-08-24
- **Contracts**: AstaVerde.sol, EcoStabilizer.sol, StabilizedCarbonCoin.sol, IAstaVerde.sol
- **Assumptions**: Canonical USDC, multisig owner, non-upgradeable
- **Overall Risk**: MEDIUM-HIGH until #107 fixed
