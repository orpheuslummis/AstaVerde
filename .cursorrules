Notes:

-   We use Solidity >0.8
-   We use ethers v6.
-   We use wagmi v2. (we will have to give you information on it)
-   Ask for clarifications or extra documentation as needed.
-   We prefer not creating new files unless really needed/useful.
-   Our overall app is pureful a client-side app, with the only backend being the blockchain with smart contracts. We don't want server-side components or a server-side API.
