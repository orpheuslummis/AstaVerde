# Webapp Reorganization Verification Report

## ✅ Verification Completed

### 1. **Folder Structure** ✅

- All directories created successfully
- 22 new files created across features, config, services, and shared folders
- Proper separation between Phase 1 (marketplace) and Phase 2 (vault) features

### 2. **Import Dependencies** ✅

**Issues Found and Fixed:**

- Fixed wagmi config imports in marketplace hooks
- Corrected path from `../../../wagmi` to `../../../config/wagmi`
- All imports now resolve correctly

### 3. **TypeScript Compilation** ✅

**Issues Found and Fixed:**

- Fixed optional chaining for `walletClient` access
- Added type assertions where needed
- Build compiles successfully: `✓ Compiled successfully`

### 4. **Backward Compatibility** ✅

- Existing code continues to work without changes
- Gradual migration path available

### 5. **Circular Dependencies** ✅

- Tested with `madge`: "✔ No circular dependency found!"
- Clean dependency graph

### 6. **Error Handling** ✅

Services properly handle:

- Wallet not connected errors
- Contract not available errors
- Invalid data format errors
- Transaction failures with retry logic
- All errors properly thrown and caught
