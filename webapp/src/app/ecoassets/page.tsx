            <p>
                I would like to introduce you to the EcoAsset
                {Image of an EcoAsset}
                Theres as much below the hood as on the front of one of these beauties
                On the front you will see the time date and location where some amazing biochar producers have been working hard to make high quality biochar making the world a bit better.
                You'll be able to see from the picture and the location that this all adds up :)
                Now lets go below the hood:
                {ItemID, Producer Wallet, Impartial verification number}
                The Item ID is the next in the sequence of EcoAssets
                Producer wallet is the wallet of the team that is working hard day in day out to make this world better with biochar
                Audit ID is the impartial verification at great expense to a company that doesn't get paid by from the sale of EcoAssets but from auditing the data against robust methodology for biochar production. This methodology includes the 'additionality' of the project. The environmental sustainability of the biomass. And the application of biochar.
                European Union concept of additionally document: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/note/join/2012/433785/EXPO-DEVE_NT(2012)433785_EN.pdf

                With all of these pieces on the face of it and under the hood having been collected and verified a proposal is put together on EcoTradeZone. Where if purchased a promised share will go to the producer and the owner (EcoTradeZone).

                Then the EcoAssets creation is completed as a result of the transactional purchase and the asset is in the buyers wallet!
