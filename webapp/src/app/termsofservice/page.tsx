        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Introduction</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Welcome to EcoTradeZone, owned and operated by BionerG Limited. (“EcoTradeZone,” “we,” “us”, or “our”). These
          Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the EcoTradeZone website(s), our APIs, mobile
          applications (“App”), and any live support, software, tools, features, or functionalities provided on or in
          connection with our services; including without limitation using our services to view, explore, help display,
          purchase, sell, or transfer NFTs on public blockchains (collectively, the “Services”).“NFT” in these Terms
          means a non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum
          blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with certain content or data.
          For purposes of these Terms, “user”, “you”, and “your” mean you as the user of the Service. If you use the
          Service on behalf of a company or other entity then “you” includes you and that entity, and you represent and
          warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to
          these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf. Please read these terms of service
          carefully as they contain important information and affect your legal rights. As outlined below, they include
          a mandatory arbitration agreement and class action waiver which (with limited exceptions) require any disputes
          between us to be resolved through individual arbitration rather than by a judge or jury in court. By clicking
          to accept, sign, and/or using our service, you agree to be bound by these terms and all of the terms
          incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to these terms, you may not access or use the service.
          EcoTradeZone is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, dealer, financial institution, payments processor,
          money services business, or creditor. EcoTradeZone provides a peer-to-peer web3 service that helps users
          discover and directly interact with each other and NFTs available on public blockchains. We do not have
          custody or control over the NFTs or blockchains you are interacting with and we do not execute or effectuate
          purchases, transfers, or sales of NFTs. To use our Service, you must use a third-party wallet which allows you
          to engage in transactions on blockchains. You bear full responsibility for verifying the legitimacy of the
          constituent parts of an EcoAsset, and authenticity of NFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers and we
          make no claims beyond the objective representation of information, and no guarantees, or recommendations about
          the legitimacy as a carbon removal, the functionality of it as a carbon removal, or trustability of the Users
          or NFTs (and any content associated with such NFTs) visible on the Service. Because we have a growing number
          of Services, we sometimes need to provide additional terms for specific Services (and such Services are deemed
          part of the “Services” hereunder and shall also be subject to these Terms). Those additional terms and
          conditions, which are available with the relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us if you
          use those Services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms we may
          provide for a specific Services, such additional terms shall control for that specific Services. EcoTradeZone
          reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make material
          changes to these Terms, we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of such changes, such as by providing
          notice through the Services or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing
          to access or use the Services, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms
          incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these Terms are updated. It is your sole
          responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that you understand
          the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Services. Accessing the Services Like much of
          web3, your blockchain address functions as your identity on EcoTradeZone. Accordingly, you will need a
          blockchain address and a third-party wallet to access the Services. Your account on the Services (“Account”)
          will be associated with your blockchain address. EcoTradeZone will be associated with your linked blockchain
          address and display the NFTs for that blockchain address (and, if applicable, any content associated with such
          NFTs). By using your wallet in connection with the Services, you agree that you are using that wallet under
          the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by,
          or affiliated with EcoTradeZone, and EcoTradeZone does not have custody or control over the contents of your
          wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. EcoTradeZone accepts no responsibility for, or
          liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding
          how the Services will operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your wallet
          secure and you should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue
          related to your wallet, please contact your wallet provider. Likewise, you are solely responsible for your
          Account and any associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with
          your Account or as a result of your Account or wallet being compromised. You agree to immediately notify us if
          you discover or otherwise suspect any security issues related to the Services or your Account (you can contact
          us chris@bionerg.com). You also represent and warrant that you will comply with all applicable laws (e.g.,
          local, state, federal and other laws) in the jurisdiction that applies to you and also the jurisdiction that
          applies in the UK while using the Services. In order to comply with our legal obligations and keep our users
          and platform safe, we may need to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to the Services. You acknowledge
          that EcoTradeZone is under no obligation to disclose the details of its decision to take such action with you.
          If you access or use the Services outside the UK, you are solely responsible for ensuring that your access and
          use of the Services in such country, territory or jurisdiction does not violate any applicable laws.
          EcoTradeZone may require you to provide additional information and documents in certain circumstances, such as
          at the request of any government authority, as any applicable law or regulation dictates, to provide you with
          a requested Services, or to investigate a potential violation of these Terms. In such cases, EcoTradeZone, in
          its sole discretion, may disable your Account and block your ability to access the Services until such
          additional information and documents are processed by EcoTradeZone. If you do not provide complete and
          accurate information in response to such a request, EcoTradeZone may refuse to restore your access to the
          Services. Your access and use of the Services may be interrupted from time to time for any of several reasons,
          including, without limitation, the malfunction of equipment, periodic updating, maintenance, or repair of the
          Services, geographic restrictions, potential violation of these Terms, or other actions that EcoTradeZone, in
          its sole discretion, may elect to take. You understand that EcoTradeZone, in its sole discretion, may disable
          your Account and/or reassign your username or associated url. We require all users to be at least 18 years
          old. Ownership The Services, including its “look and feel” (e.g., text, graphics, images, logos, page headers,
          button icons, urls, and scripts), proprietary content, information and other materials, and all content and
          other materials contained therein, including, without limitation, the EcoTradeZone logo and all designs, text,
          graphics, pictures, data, software, sound files, other files, and the selection and arrangement thereof are
          the proprietary property of EcoTradeZone or our affiliates, licensors, or users, as applicable, and you agree

          users, as applicable, reserve all rights in connection with the Services and its content, including, without
          limitation, the exclusive right to create derivative works. EcoTradeZone’s name, logo, trademarks, and any

          EcoTradeZone or our affiliates or licensors and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part,
          without our prior written permission in each instance. You may not use any metatags or other “hidden text”
          utilizing “EcoTradeZone” or any other name, trademark or product or Services name of EcoTradeZone or our
          affiliates or licensors without our prior written permission. In addition, the “look and feel” of the Services
          constitutes the Services mark, trademark or trade dress of EcoTradeZone and may not be copied, imitated or
          used, in whole or in part, without our prior written permission. All other third-party trademarks, registered
          trademarks, and product names mentioned on the Services or contained in the content linked to or associated
          with any NFTs displayed on the Services are the property of their respective owners and may not be copied,
          imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the permission of the applicable intellectual property rights
          holder. Reference to any products, Services, processes or other information by name, trademark, manufacturer,
          supplier or otherwise does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation by
          EcoTradeZone. We welcome feedback, comments, and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“Feedback”).
          You acknowledge and expressly agree that any contribution of Feedback does not and will not give or grant you
          any right, title, or interest in the Services or in any such Feedback. You agree that EcoTradeZone may use and
          disclose Feedback in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever without further notice or compensation to you
          and without retention by you of any proprietary or other right or claim. You hereby assign to EcoTradeZone any
          and all right, title, and interest (including, but not limited to, any patent, copyright, trade secret,
          trademark, show-how, know-how, moral rights and any and all other intellectual property right) that you may
          have in and to any and all Feedback. EcoTradeZone does not have ownership, custody, or control of NFTs or the
          smart contracts deployed by third parties. Creators of these NFTs or smart contracts are solely responsible
          for their operation and functionality. License to Access and Use Our Services and Content You are hereby
          granted a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, and personal license to access and use the
          Services provided, however, that such license is subject to your compliance with these Terms. If any software,
          content, or other materials owned by, controlled by, or licensed to us are distributed or made available to
          you as part of your use of the Services, we hereby grant you a non-commercial, personal, non-assignable,
          non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, and non-exclusive right and license to access and display such software,
          content, and materials provided to you as part of the Services (and right to download a single copy onto your
          applicable equipment or device), in each case for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the Services as
          permitted by these Terms, provided that your license in any content linked to or associated with any NFTs is
          solely as set forth by the applicable seller or creator of such NFT. Third-Party Content, Agreements, and
          Services As a peer-to-peer web3 Services, EcoTradeZone helps you explore NFTs known as Eco Assets and interact
          with different blockchains. We also cannot guarantee that any NFTs visible on EcoTradeZone will always remain
          visible and/or available to be bought, sold, or transferred. Users are solely responsible for any content
          related to their NFTs. These Terms solely govern the use of our Services. NFTs are available on public
          blockchains, are purchased, sold, or transferred between a buyer, seller and/or creator directly, and may be
          purchased, sold, or transferred by buyers, sellers, and/or creators without the use of our Services and
          therefore without agreeing to our Terms. There may be terms and conditions that apply to the NFTs&apos; themselves
          set directly between buyers, sellers, and/or creators with respect to the NFT including with respect to the
          use of the NFT content and rights and obligations associated with a given NFT (&quot;NFT Terms&quot;). For example, when
          you click to get more details about any of the NFTs or NFT collections visible on EcoTradeZone or view the NFT
          metadata, you may notice a third-party link to NFT Terms governing the use of the NFT that you will be
          required to comply with. EcoTradeZone does not set the NFT Terms and is not party to any such NFT Terms, which
          are solely between the buyer, seller, and/or creator. The buyer, seller, and/or creator are entirely
          responsible for communicating, promulgating, agreeing to, and enforcing NFT Terms. You are responsible for
          reviewing such NFT Terms. Sellers are solely responsible for determining and establishing the price of an NFT,
          inclusive of any applicable tax. For its Services, EcoTradeZone may receive certain fees. EcoTradeZone does
          not set, collect, or determine other applicable costs, fees, and expenses associated with buying and selling
          an NFT, including but not limited to any creator earnings, gas, or transaction fees. These costs, fees, and
          expenses are paid directly to the seller, creator, payment processor, blockchain validator, or other third
          party, as applicable. Because these costs, fees, and expenses are not collected by EcoTradeZone, it cannot
          refund them. The Services may also contain links or functionality to access or use third-party websites
          (“Third-Party Websites”) and applications (“Third-Party Applications”), or otherwise display, include, or make
          available content, data, information, Services, applications, or materials from third parties (“Third-Party
          Materials”). When you click on a link to, or access and use, a Third-Party Website or Third-Party Application,
          though we may not warn you that you have left our Services, you are subject to the terms and conditions
          (including privacy policies) of another website or destination. Such Third-Party Websites, Third-Party
          Applications, and Third-Party Materials are not under the control of EcoTradeZone, and may be “open”
          applications for which no recourse is possible. EcoTradeZone is not responsible or liable for any Third-Party
          Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party Materials. EcoTradeZone provides links to these
          Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Applications only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor,
          endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Websites or Third-Party
          Applications, or their products or Services or associated Third-Party Materials. You use all links in
          Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party Materials at your own risk. User Conduct
          Thanks to all of the latest innovation and hard work that has been put into the blockchain by so many people,
          we can bring trustability to the ecological care of our planet. However, to protect our community and comply
          with our legal obligations, we reserve the right to take action, with or without advance notice, if we

          following terms and conditions apply to you only if you are using the App from the Apple App Store: To the
          extent the other terms and conditions of these Terms are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with,
          the terms and conditions of this paragraph, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in this
          paragraph apply, but solely with respect to your use of the App from the Apple App Store. You acknowledge and
          agree that these Terms are solely between you and EcoTradeZone, not Apple, and that Apple has no
          responsibility for the App or content thereof. Your use of the App must comply with the App Store’s applicable
          terms of use. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support
          Services with respect to the App. In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable
          warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if any, for the App to you. To the
          maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with
          respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any
          failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by these Terms. You acknowledge that Apple is not
          responsible for addressing any claims of yours or any third party relating to the App or your possession
          and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (a) product liability claims, (b) any claim that the App
          fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and (c) claims arising under consumer
          protection or similar legislation. You acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App or
          your possession and use of that App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, EcoTradeZone,
          not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such
          intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms. You must comply with
          applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App. You acknowledge and agree that Apple, and
          Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as they relate to your use of the App, and
          that, upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the
          right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof. Indemnification By agreeing to
          these Terms and accessing the Services, you agree, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to
          indemnify, defend, and hold harmless EcoTradeZone, and our respective past, present, and future employees,
          officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, Services providers, parent
          companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors, and assigns
          (individually and collectively, the “EcoTradeZone Parties”), from and against all actual or alleged claims,
          damages, awards, judgments, losses, liabilities, obligations, taxes, penalties, interest, fees, expenses
          (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses), and costs (including, without limitation, court
          costs, costs of settlement, and costs of pursuing indemnification and insurance), of every kind and nature
          whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, or suspected or
          unsuspected, in law or equity, whether in tort, contract, or otherwise (collectively, “Claims”), including,
          but not limited to, damages to property or personal injury, that are caused by, arise out of or are related to
          (a) your use or misuse of the Services, content, NFTs, or content linked to or associated with any NFTs (b)
          any Feedback you provide, (c) your violation or breach of any term of these Terms or applicable law, and (d)
          your violation of the rights of or obligations to a third party, including another user or third party, and
          (e) your negligence or wilful misconduct. You agree to promptly notify EcoTradeZone of any Claims and
          cooperate with the EcoTradeZone Parties in defending such Claims. You further agree that the EcoTradeZone
          Parties shall have control of the defense or settlement of any Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and
          not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and EcoTradeZone.
          Disclaimers Your access to and use of the services is at your own risk. You understand and agree that the
          services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis and EcoTradeZone expressly disclaims warranties
          or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. EcoTradeZone (and its suppliers) make no warranty or
          representation and disclaim all responsibility for whether the services: (a) will meet your requirements; (b)
          will be available on an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free basis; or (c) will be accurate, reliable,
          complete, legal, or safe. EcoTradeZone disclaims all other warranties or conditions, express or implied,
          including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular
          purpose, title and non-infringement. EcoTradeZone will not be liable for any loss of any kind from any action
          taken or taken in reliance on material or information, contained on the services. While EcoTradeZone attempts
          to make your access to and use of the services safe, EcoTradeZone cannot and does not represent or warrant
          that the services, content, content linked to or associated with any NFTs, or any NFTs you interact with using
          our services or our services providers’ servers are free of viruses or other harmful components. We cannot
          guarantee the security of any data that you disclose online. No advice or information, whether oral or
          obtained from the EcoTradeZone parties or through the services, will create any warranty or representation not
          expressly made herein. You accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing online over
          the Internet and will not hold EcoTradeZone responsible for any breach of security. We will not be responsible
          or liable to you for any loss and take no responsibility for, and will not be liable to you for, any use of or
          loss of use of NFTs, content, and/or content linked to or associated with NFTs, including but not limited to
          any losses, damages, or claims arising from: (a) user error, incorrectly constructed transactions, or mistyped
          addresses; (b) server failure or data loss; (c) unauthorized access or use; (d) any unauthorized third-party
          activities, including without limitation the use of viruses, phishing, brute-forcing or other means of attack
          against the services or NFTs. NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the associated
          blockchain (e.g., Ethereum network). Any transfers or sales occur on the associated blockchain (e.g.,
          Ethereum). EcoTradeZone and/or any other EcoTradeZone party cannot effect or otherwise control the transfer of
          title or right in any NFTs or underlying or associated content or items. No EcoTradeZone party is responsible
          or liable for any sustained losses or injury due to vulnerability or any kind of failure, abnormal behavior of
          software (e.g., wallet, smart contract), blockchains or any other features of the NFTs. No EcoTradeZone party
          is responsible for losses or injury due to late reports by developers or representatives (or no report at all)
          of any issues with the blockchain supporting the NFTs, including forks, technical node issues or any other
          issues having losses or injury as a result. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied
          warranties in contracts with consumers, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. Assumption of Risk You
          accept and acknowledge: The value of an NFT is subjective. Prices of NFTs are subject to volatility and
          fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect NFT prices. You
          acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money. You
          understand that you are responsible for any fees related to use of the Services, including for actions you
          take on the blockchain, regardless of whether a successful transaction occurs, and that such fees are final
          and irreversible. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems
          could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also
          negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies,
          non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or
          policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Services and the utility of NFTs. You are
          solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions and to withhold, collect,
          report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. EcoTradeZone is not
          responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes that apply to your
          NFTs or the sale/purchase of your NFTs. There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with
          content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of
          purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart
          contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable. You represent and warrant that you have done
          sufficient research before making any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs
          or accounts/collections. We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and we do not
          control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on
          these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and EcoTradeZone has no
          ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain. There are risks associated with using Internet and
          blockchain based products, including, but not limited to, the risk associated with hardware, software, and
          Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain
          unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account. You accept and acknowledge that EcoTradeZone will
          not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may
          experience when using the Services or any Blockchain network, however caused. EcoTradeZone reserves the right
          to hide collections, contracts, and items affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Items you
          purchase may become inaccessible on EcoTradeZone. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view items on
          EcoTradeZone or an inability to use the Services in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or transfer of items
          available on any blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against EcoTradeZone. If you have a dispute with one
          or more users, You release us from claims, demands, and damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown,
          arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. In entering into this release you expressly waive
          any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to
          include those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this
          release. Limitation of Liability To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree that in no event will
          EcoTradeZone or its services providers be liable to you or any third party (a) for any lost profit or any
          indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, or punitive damages arising from these terms or the
          services, products or third-party sites and products, or for any damages related to loss of revenue, loss of
          profits, loss of business or anticipated savings, loss of use, loss of goodwill, or loss of data, and whether
          caused by strict liability or tort (including negligence), breach of contract, or otherwise, even if
          foreseeable and even if EcoTradeZone or its services providers have been advised of the possibility of such
          damages; or (b) for any other claim, demand, or damages whatsoever resulting from or arising out of or in
          connection with these terms of the delivery, use, or performance of the services. Access to, and use of, the
          services, products or third-party sites, and products are at your own discretion and risk, and you will be
          solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or mobile device or loss of data resulting
          therefrom. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the maximum aggregate
          liability of EcoTradeZone arising out of or in any way related to these terms, the access to and use of the
          services, content, NFTs, or any EcoTradeZone products or services exceed the greater of (a) $100 or (b) the
          amount received by EcoTradeZone for its services to you directly relating to the items that are the subject of
          the claim. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential
          purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages,
          so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or
          limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to
          personal injury claims. Privacy Policy Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how we
          collect, use, and share information from and/or about you (&quot;Your Information&quot;). By submitting Your Information
          through our Services, you agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the
          collection, use, and disclosure of Your Information in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Modifications to
          the Services We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or
          permanently, the Services (or any features or parts thereof) at any time and without liability as a result.
          Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Dispute Resolution. Please read the following arbitration agreement in this
          Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with EcoTradeZone and
          limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. This section does not govern disputes between users or
          between users and third parties. EcoTradeZone does not provide dispute resolution Services for such
          disagreements and the parties must resolve those disputes directly. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.
          You agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Services,
          to any products sold or distributed through the Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with
          EcoTradeZone, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, including threshold questions of
          the arbitrability of such dispute, controversy, or claim except that (1) you or EcoTradeZone may assert claims
          in small claims court, but only if the claims qualify, the claims remain only in such court, and the claims
          remain on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis; and (2) you or EcoTradeZone may seek
          injunctive or equitable relief in a court of proper jurisdiction if the claim relates to intellectual property
          infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Dispute resolution process. You and EcoTradeZone
          both agree to engage in good-faith efforts to resolve disputes prior to either party initiating an
          arbitration, small claims court proceeding, or equitable relief for intellectual property infringement. You
          must initiate this dispute resolution process by sending an email describing the nature of your claim and
          desired resolution to: chris@bionerg.com. Both parties agree to meet and confer personally, by telephone, or
          by videoconference (hereinafter “Conference”) to discuss the dispute and attempt in good faith to reach a
          mutually beneficial outcome that avoids the expenses of arbitration or, where applicable, litigation. If you
          are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but you agree to fully
          participate in the Conference. Likewise, if EcoTradeZone is represented by counsel, its counsel may
          participate in the Conference as well, but EcoTradeZone agrees to have a company representative fully
          participate in the Conference. If the parties do not reach agreement to resolve the dispute within sixty (60)
          days after initiation of this dispute resolution process, either party may refer the matter to the London
          Court of Arbitration in the manner set out below entitled Governing Law and Venue Authority of Arbitrator. The
          arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration
          Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or
          formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this
          Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of
          you and EcoTradeZone. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined
          with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all
          or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any
          non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and
          these Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
          findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The
          arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would
          have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Waiver of jury trial. You and
          EcoTradeZone hereby waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of
          a judge or a jury. You and EcoTradeZone are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
          arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, (“Applicability of Arbitration Agreement”). An arbitrator can
          award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court
          would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject
          to very limited review. Severability. Except as provided in this Section, if any part or parts of this
          Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts
          shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall
          continue in full force and effect. Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the
          termination of your relationship with EcoTradeZone. Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms
          to the contrary, we agree that if EcoTradeZone makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement,
          you may reject that change within sixty (60) days of such change becoming effective in writing by email to
          chris@bionerg.com Governing Law and Venue This agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in
          connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be
          governed by and construed in accordance with English law. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with
          this Agreement shall to the extent possible be settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within
          sixty (60) Business Days from the date of written notice by either Party to the other Party of the existence
          of such dispute. Where a dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement cannot be settled
          amicably through negotiation, such disputes are to be resolved finally by arbitration in accordance with the
          Arbitration Rules of the London Court of Arbitration. (a) The language of the Arbitration shall be English,
          (b) The Arbitral seat shall be London, (c) The Arbitral venue shall be London or any other suitable venue for
          the parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree to the conducting of virtual hearings whether
          through conference calls, video conference or other communications technology Termination If you breach any of
          the provisions of these Terms, all licenses granted by EcoTradeZone will terminate automatically.
          Additionally, notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, with or without notice
          and in our sole discretion, to suspend, restrict, disable, terminate, or delete your Account and/or your
          ability to access or use the Services (or any part of the foregoing) at any time and for any or no reason, and
          you acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you in such event and that you will
          not be entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid to us. If we terminate your Account or
          restrict your access or use of the Services, you retain ownership of your NFTs. You may still access your NFTs
          through public blockchains and other web3 wallets, platforms, and/or websites. Severability If any term,
          clause, or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause, or provision
          will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of
          that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision of these Terms. Injunctive Relief You
          agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to EcoTradeZone for which monetary damages
          would not be an adequate remedy and EcoTradeZone shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any
          remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security, or proof of damages. Export Laws You
          agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Services, and/or other information or
          materials provided by EcoTradeZone hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any other relevant
          jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export without first
          obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or
          re-exported (a) into any embargoed countries or any country that has been designated as a “terrorist
          supporting” country, or (b) to anyone listed on any U.K. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
          By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such
          list. You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply at your sole expense with all applicable U.K. export
          laws and regulations. Survival All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these
          Terms shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of these Terms
          by EcoTradeZone or you. Termination will not limit any of EcoTradeZone’s other rights or remedies at law or in
          equity. Miscellaneous These Terms (and any other applicable terms or policies incorporated by reference in
          these Terms) constitute the entire agreement between you and EcoTradeZone relating to your access to and use
          of the Services. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or
          assigned by you without the prior written consent of EcoTradeZone, and EcoTradeZone’s failure to assert any
          right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by
          either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent
          breach or default. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any
          legal effect. The Services is operated by us in the United Kingdom.. Those who choose to access the Services
          from locations outside the United Kingdom do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance
          with applicable local laws. You and EcoTradeZone agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
          International Sale of Goods will not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms. Except as
          otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended
          to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
