        EcoTradeZone Terms of Service Last Updated: 31 Jan 2024 Introduction Welcome to EcoTradeZone, owned and operated
        by BionerG Limited. (“EcoTradeZone,” “we,” “us”, or “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access
        to and use of the EcoTradeZone website(s), our APIs, mobile applications (“App”), and any live support,
        software, tools, features, or functionalities provided on or in connection with our services; including without
        limitation using our services to view, explore, help display, purchase, sell, or transfer NFTs on public
        blockchains (collectively, the “Services”). “NFT” in these Terms means a non-fungible token or similar digital
        item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or
        otherwise be associated with certain content or data. For purposes of these Terms, “user”, “you”, and “your”
        mean you as the user of the Service. If you use the Service on behalf of a company or other entity then “you”
        includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the
        entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity’s
        behalf. Please read these terms of service carefully as they contain important information and affect your legal
        rights. As outlined below, they include a mandatory arbitration agreement and class action waiver which (with
        limited exceptions) require any disputes between us to be resolved through individual arbitration rather than by
        a judge or jury in court. By clicking to accept, sign, and/or using our service, you agree to be bound by these
        terms and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to these terms, you may not
        access or use the service. EcoTradeZone is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, dealer, financial
        institution, payments processor, money services business, or creditor. EcoTradeZone provides a peer-to-peer web3
        service that helps users discover and directly interact with each other and NFTs available on public
        blockchains. We do not have custody or control over the NFTs or blockchains you are interacting with and we do
        not execute or effectuate purchases, transfers, or sales of NFTs. To use our Service, you must use a third-party
        wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains. You bear full responsibility for verifying the
        legitimacy of the constituent parts of an EcoAsset, and authenticity of NFTs that you purchase from third-party
        sellers and we make no claims beyond the objective representation of information, and no guarantees, or
        recommendations about the legitimacy as a carbon removal, the functionality of it as a carbon removal, or
        trustability of the Users or NFTs (and any content associated with such NFTs) visible on the Service. Because we
        have a growing number of Services, we sometimes need to provide additional terms for specific Services (and such
        Services are deemed part of the “Services” hereunder and shall also be subject to these Terms). Those additional
        terms and conditions, which are available with the relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us
        if you use those Services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms we
        may provide for a specific Services, such additional terms shall control for that specific Services.
        EcoTradeZone reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we
        make material changes to these Terms, we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of such changes, such as
        by providing notice through the Services or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. By
        continuing to access or use the Services, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms
        incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these Terms are updated. It is your sole
        responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that you understand the
        terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Services. Accessing the Services Like much of web3,
        your blockchain address functions as your identity on EcoTradeZone. Accordingly, you will need a blockchain
        address and a third-party wallet to access the Services. Your account on the Services (“Account”) will be
        associated with your blockchain address. EcoTradeZone will be associated with your linked blockchain address and
        display the NFTs for that blockchain address (and, if applicable, any content associated with such NFTs). By
        using your wallet in connection with the Services, you agree that you are using that wallet under the terms and
        conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated
        with EcoTradeZone, and EcoTradeZone does not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and has no
        ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. EcoTradeZone accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you,
        in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the Services
        will operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your wallet secure and you should
        never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue related to your wallet,
        please contact your wallet provider. Likewise, you are solely responsible for your Account and any associated
        wallet and we are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Account or as a result of
        your Account or wallet being compromised. You agree to immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise
        suspect any security issues related to the Services or your Account (you can contact us chris@bionerg.com). You
        also represent and warrant that you will comply with all applicable laws (e.g., local, state, federal and other
        laws) in the jurisdiction that applies to you and also the jurisdiction that applies in the UK while using the
        Services. In order to comply with our legal obligations and keep our users and platform safe, we may need to
        restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to the Services. You acknowledge that EcoTradeZone is under no
        obligation to disclose the details of its decision to take such action with you. If you access or use the
        Services outside the UK, you are solely responsible for ensuring that your access and use of the Services in
        such country, territory or jurisdiction does not violate any applicable laws. EcoTradeZone may require you to
        provide additional information and documents in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government
        authority, as any applicable law or regulation dictates, to provide you with a requested Services, or to
        investigate a potential violation of these Terms. In such cases, EcoTradeZone, in its sole discretion, may
        disable your Account and block your ability to access the Services until such additional information and
        documents are processed by EcoTradeZone. If you do not provide complete and accurate information in response to
        such a request, EcoTradeZone may refuse to restore your access to the Services. Your access and use of the
        Services may be interrupted from time to time for any of several reasons, including, without limitation, the
        malfunction of equipment, periodic updating, maintenance, or repair of the Services, geographic restrictions,
        potential violation of these Terms, or other actions that EcoTradeZone, in its sole discretion, may elect to
        take. You understand that EcoTradeZone, in its sole discretion, may disable your Account and/or reassign your
        username or associated url. We require all users to be at least 18 years old. Ownership The Services, including
        its “look and feel” (e.g., text, graphics, images, logos, page headers, button icons, urls, and scripts),
        proprietary content, information and other materials, and all content and other materials contained therein,

        addition, the “look and feel” of the Services constitutes the Services mark, trademark or trade dress of

        All other third-party trademarks, registered trademarks, and product names mentioned on the Services or

        EcoTradeZone may use and disclose Feedback in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever without further notice
        or compensation to you and without retention by you of any proprietary or other right or claim. You hereby
        assign to EcoTradeZone any and all right, title, and interest (including, but not limited to, any patent,
        copyright, trade secret, trademark, show-how, know-how, moral rights and any and all other intellectual property
        right) that you may have in and to any and all Feedback. EcoTradeZone does not have ownership, custody, or
        control of NFTs or the smart contracts deployed by third parties. Creators of these NFTs or smart contracts are
        solely responsible for their operation and functionality. License to Access and Use Our Services and Content You
        are hereby granted a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, and personal license to access
        and use the Services provided, however, that such license is subject to your compliance with these Terms. If any
        software, content, or other materials owned by, controlled by, or licensed to us are distributed or made
        available to you as part of your use of the Services, we hereby grant you a non-commercial, personal,
        non-assignable, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, and non-exclusive right and license to access and display
        such software, content, and materials provided to you as part of the Services (and right to download a single
        copy onto your applicable equipment or device), in each case for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the
        Services as permitted by these Terms, provided that your license in any content linked to or associated with any
        NFTs is solely as set forth by the applicable seller or creator of such NFT. Third-Party Content, Agreements,
        and Services As a peer-to-peer web3 Services, EcoTradeZone helps you explore NFTs known as EcoAssets and
        interact with different blockchains. We also cannot guarantee that any NFTs visible on EcoTradeZone will always
        remain visible and/or available to be bought, sold, or transferred. Users are solely responsible for any content
        related to their NFTs. These Terms solely govern the use of our Services. NFTs are available on public
        blockchains, are purchased, sold, or transferred between a buyer, seller and/or creator directly, and may be
        purchased, sold, or transferred by buyers, sellers, and/or creators without the use of our Services and
        therefore without agreeing to our Terms. There may be terms and conditions that apply to the NFTs' themselves
        set directly between buyers, sellers, and/or creators with respect to the NFT including with respect to the use
        of the NFT content and rights and obligations associated with a given NFT ("NFT Terms"). For example, when you
        click to get more details about any of the NFTs or NFT collections visible on EcoTradeZone or view the NFT
        metadata, you may notice a third-party link to NFT Terms governing the use of the NFT that you will be required
        to comply with. EcoTradeZone does not set the NFT Terms and is not party to any such NFT Terms, which are solely
        between the buyer, seller, and/or creator. The buyer, seller, and/or creator are entirely responsible for
        communicating, promulgating, agreeing to, and enforcing NFT Terms. You are responsible for reviewing such NFT
        Terms. Sellers are solely responsible for determining and establishing the price of an NFT, inclusive of any
        applicable tax. For its Services, EcoTradeZone may receive certain fees. EcoTradeZone does not set, collect, or
        determine other applicable costs, fees, and expenses associated with buying and selling an NFT, including but
        not limited to any creator earnings, gas, or transaction fees. These costs, fees, and expenses are paid directly
        to the seller, creator, payment processor, blockchain validator, or other third party, as applicable. Because
        these costs, fees, and expenses are not collected by EcoTradeZone, it cannot refund them. The Services may also
        contain links or functionality to access or use third-party websites (“Third-Party Websites”) and applications
        (“Third-Party Applications”), or otherwise display, include, or make available content, data, information,
        Services, applications, or materials from third parties (“Third-Party Materials”). When you click on a link to,
        or access and use, a Third-Party Website or Third-Party Application, though we may not warn you that you have
        left our Services, you are subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy policies) of another website
        or destination. Such Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party Materials are not under the
        control of EcoTradeZone, and may be “open” applications for which no recourse is possible. EcoTradeZone is not
        responsible or liable for any Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party Materials.
        EcoTradeZone provides links to these Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Applications only as a convenience and
        does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party
        Websites or Third-Party Applications, or their products or Services or associated Third-Party Materials. You use
        all links in Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and Third-Party Materials at your own risk. User
        Conduct Thanks to all of the latest innovation and hard work that has been put into the blockchain by so many
        people, we can bring trustability to the ecological care of our planet. However, to protect our community and
        comply with our legal obligations, we reserve the right to take action, with or without advance notice, if we
        believe, in our sole discretion, that you have violated these Terms or that you may use our Services for
        unlawful activity. This may include, but is not limited to, removing or limiting the ability to view or interact

        deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
        Indemnification By agreeing to these Terms and accessing the Services, you agree, to the fullest extent
        permitted by applicable law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless EcoTradeZone, and our respective past,
        present, and future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers,
        vendors, Services providers, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors,
        successors, and assigns (individually and collectively, the “EcoTradeZone Parties”), from and against all actual
        or alleged claims, damages, awards, judgments, losses, liabilities, obligations, taxes, penalties, interest,
        fees, expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses), and costs (including, without
        limitation, court costs, costs of settlement, and costs of pursuing indemnification and insurance), of every
        kind and nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, or suspected
        or unsuspected, in law or equity, whether in tort, contract, or otherwise (collectively, “Claims”), including,
        but not limited to, damages to property or personal injury, that are caused by, arise out of or are related to
        (a) your use or misuse of the Services, content, NFTs, or content linked to or associated with any NFTs (b) any
        Feedback you provide, (c) your violation or breach of any term of these Terms or applicable law, and (d) your
        violation of the rights of or obligations to a third party, including another user or third party, and (e) your
        negligence or wilful misconduct. You agree to promptly notify EcoTradeZone of any Claims and cooperate with the
        EcoTradeZone Parties in defending such Claims. You further agree that the EcoTradeZone Parties shall have
        control of the defense or settlement of any Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any
        other indemnities set forth in a written agreement between you and EcoTradeZone. Disclaimers Your access to and
        use of the services is at your own risk. You understand and agree that the services are provided on an “as is”
        and “as available” basis and EcoTradeZone expressly disclaims warranties or conditions of any kind, either
        express or implied. EcoTradeZone (and its suppliers) make no warranty or representation and disclaim all
        responsibility for whether the services: (a) will meet your requirements; (b) will be available on an
        uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free basis; or (c) will be accurate, reliable, complete, legal, or safe.
        EcoTradeZone disclaims all other warranties or conditions, express or implied, including, without limitation,
        implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
        non-infringement. EcoTradeZone will not be liable for any loss of any kind from any action taken or taken in
        reliance on material or information, contained on the services. While EcoTradeZone attempts to make your access
        to and use of the services safe, EcoTradeZone cannot and does not represent or warrant that the services,
        content, content linked to or associated with any NFTs, or any NFTs you interact with using our services or our
        services providers’ servers are free of viruses or other harmful components. We cannot guarantee the security of
        any data that you disclose online. No advice or information, whether oral or obtained from the EcoTradeZone
        parties or through the services, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. You
        accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing online over the Internet and will not
        hold EcoTradeZone responsible for any breach of security. We will not be responsible or liable to you for any
        loss and take no responsibility for, and will not be liable to you for, any use of or loss of use of NFTs,
        content, and/or content linked to or associated with NFTs, including but not limited to any losses, damages, or
        claims arising from: (a) user error, incorrectly constructed transactions, or mistyped addresses; (b) server
        failure or data loss; (c) unauthorized access or use; (d) any unauthorized third-party activities, including
        without limitation the use of viruses, phishing, brute-forcing or other means of attack against the services or
        NFTs. NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the associated blockchain (e.g., Ethereum
        network). Any transfers or sales occur on the associated blockchain (e.g., Ethereum). EcoTradeZone and/or any
        other EcoTradeZone party cannot effect or otherwise control the transfer of title or right in any NFTs or
        underlying or associated content or items. No EcoTradeZone party is responsible or liable for any sustained
        losses or injury due to vulnerability or any kind of failure, abnormal behavior of software (e.g., wallet, smart
        contract), blockchains or any other features of the NFTs. No EcoTradeZone party is responsible for losses or
        injury due to late reports by developers or representatives (or no report at all) of any issues with the
        blockchain supporting the NFTs, including forks, technical node issues or any other issues having losses or
        injury as a result. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties in contracts with
        consumers, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. Assumption of Risk You accept and acknowledge: The value
        of an NFT is subjective. Prices of NFTs are subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price of
        cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect NFT prices. You acknowledge that you fully understand
        this subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money. You understand that you are responsible for any
        fees related to use of the Services, including for actions you take on the blockchain, regardless of whether a
        successful transaction occurs, and that such fees are final and irreversible. A lack of use or public interest
        in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those
        ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs.
        The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrency, and other
        crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development
        of the Services and the utility of NFTs. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to
        your transactions and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate
        tax authorities. EcoTradeZone is not responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting, or
        remitting any taxes that apply to your NFTs or the sale/purchase of your NFTs. There are risks associated with
        purchasing items associated with content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including
        but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to
        metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable. You represent and
        warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or
        otherwise interact with any NFTs or accounts/collections. We do not control the public blockchains that you are
        interacting with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your
        ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are
        irreversible and EcoTradeZone has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain. There are risks
        associated with using Internet and blockchain based products, including, but not limited to, the risk associated
        with hardware, software, and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk
        that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account. You accept and
        acknowledge that EcoTradeZone will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors,
        distortions or delays you may experience when using the Services or any Blockchain network, however caused.
        EcoTradeZone reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and items affected by any of these issues or by
        other issues. Items you purchase may become inaccessible on EcoTradeZone. Under no circumstances shall the
        inability to view items on EcoTradeZone or an inability to use the Services in conjunction with the purchase,
        sale, or transfer of items available on any blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against EcoTradeZone. If
        you have a dispute with one or more users, You release us from claims, demands, and damages of every kind and
        nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. In entering into this
        release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the
        coverage of this release to include those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the
        time of agreeing to this release. Limitation of Liability To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree that
        in no event will EcoTradeZone or its services providers be liable to you or any third party (a) for any lost
        profit or any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, or punitive damages arising from these
        terms or the services, products or third-party sites and products, or for any damages related to loss of
        revenue, loss of profits, loss of business or anticipated savings, loss of use, loss of goodwill, or loss of
        data, and whether caused by strict liability or tort (including negligence), breach of contract, or otherwise,
        even if foreseeable and even if EcoTradeZone or its services providers have been advised of the possibility of
        such damages; or (b) for any other claim, demand, or damages whatsoever resulting from or arising out of or in
        connection with these terms of the delivery, use, or performance of the services. Access to, and use of, the
        services, products or third-party sites, and products are at your own discretion and risk, and you will be
        solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or mobile device or loss of data resulting therefrom.
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the maximum aggregate liability of
        EcoTradeZone arising out of or in any way related to these terms, the access to and use of the services,
        content, NFTs, or any EcoTradeZone products or services exceed the greater of (a) $100 or (b) the amount
        received by EcoTradeZone for its services to you directly relating to the items that are the subject of the
        claim. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some
        jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above
        limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of
        liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury
        claims. Privacy Policy Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how we collect, use, and share
        information from and/or about you ("Your Information"). By submitting Your Information through our Services, you
        agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of
        Your Information in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Modifications to the Services We reserve the right in
        our sole discretion to modify, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any
        features or parts thereof) at any time and without liability as a result. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration
        Dispute Resolution. Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”)
        carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with EcoTradeZone and limits the manner in which you can seek
        relief from us. This section does not govern disputes between users or between users and third parties.
        EcoTradeZone does not provide dispute resolution Services for such disagreements and the parties must resolve
        those disputes directly. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute, controversy, or
        claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any products sold or distributed through the
        Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with EcoTradeZone, will be resolved by binding arbitration,
        rather than in court, including threshold questions of the arbitrability of such dispute, controversy, or claim
        except that (1) you or EcoTradeZone may assert claims in small claims court, but only if the claims qualify, the
        claims remain only in such court, and the claims remain on an individual, non-representative, and non-class
        basis; and (2) you or EcoTradeZone may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of proper jurisdiction if
        the claim relates to intellectual property infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. Dispute
        resolution process. You and EcoTradeZone both agree to engage in good-faith efforts to resolve disputes prior to
        either party initiating an arbitration, small claims court proceeding, or equitable relief for intellectual
        property infringement. You must initiate this dispute resolution process by sending an email describing the
        nature of your claim and desired resolution to: chris@bionerg.com. Both parties agree to meet and confer
        personally, by telephone, or by videoconference (hereinafter “Conference”) to discuss the dispute and attempt in
        good faith to reach a mutually beneficial outcome that avoids the expenses of arbitration or, where applicable,
        litigation. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but you
        agree to fully participate in the Conference. Likewise, if EcoTradeZone is represented by counsel, its counsel
        may participate in the Conference as well, but EcoTradeZone agrees to have a company representative fully
        participate in the Conference. If the parties do not reach agreement to resolve the dispute within sixty (60)
        days after initiation of this dispute resolution process, either party may refer the matter to the London Court
        of Arbitration in the manner set out below entitled Governing Law and Venue Authority of Arbitrator. The
        arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration
        Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation
        of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration
        Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and
        EcoTradeZone. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any
        other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of
        any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary
        remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and these Terms.
        The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and
        conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has
        the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award
        of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Waiver of jury trial. You and EcoTradeZone hereby waive
        any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. You and
        EcoTradeZone are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this
        Arbitration Agreement, (“Applicability of Arbitration Agreement”). An arbitrator can award on an individual
        basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is no
        judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
        Severability. Except as provided in this Section, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found
        under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect
        and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
        Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with
        EcoTradeZone. Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if
        EcoTradeZone makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within
        sixty (60) days of such change becoming effective in writing by email to chris@bionerg.com Governing Law and
        Venue This agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or
        formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
        English law. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall to the extent possible be
        settled amicably by negotiation between the Parties within sixty (60) Business Days from the date of written
        notice by either Party to the other Party of the existence of such dispute. Where a dispute arising out of or in
        connection with this Agreement cannot be settled amicably through negotiation, such disputes are to be resolved
        finally by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the London Court of Arbitration. (a) The
        language of the Arbitration shall be English, (b) The Arbitral seat shall be London, (c) The Arbitral venue
        shall be London or any other suitable venue for the parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree to
        the conducting of virtual hearings whether through conference calls, video conference or other communications
        technology Termination If you breach any of the provisions of these Terms, all licenses granted by EcoTradeZone
        will terminate automatically. Additionally, notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the
        right, with or without notice and in our sole discretion, to suspend, restrict, disable, terminate, or delete
        your Account and/or your ability to access or use the Services (or any part of the foregoing) at any time and
        for any or no reason, and you acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you in such
        event and that you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid to us. If we
        terminate your Account or restrict your access or use of the Services, you retain ownership of your NFTs. You
        may still access your NFTs through public blockchains and other web3 wallets, platforms, and/or websites.
        Severability If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term,
        clause, or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of
        any remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision of these Terms.
        Injunctive Relief You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to EcoTradeZone for which
        monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and EcoTradeZone shall be entitled to equitable relief in
        addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security, or proof of damages.
        Export Laws You agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Services, and/or other
        information or materials provided by EcoTradeZone hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any
        other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export
        without first obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be
        exported or re-exported (a) into any embargoed countries or any country that has been designated as a “terrorist
        supporting” country, or (b) to anyone listed on any U.K. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. By
        using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.
        You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply at your sole expense with all applicable U.K. export laws and
        regulations. Survival All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall
        continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of these Terms by
        EcoTradeZone or you. Termination will not limit any of EcoTradeZone’s other rights or remedies at law or in
        equity. Miscellaneous These Terms (and any other applicable terms or policies incorporated by reference in these
        Terms) constitute the entire agreement between you and EcoTradeZone relating to your access to and use of the
        Services. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you
        without the prior written consent of EcoTradeZone, and EcoTradeZone’s failure to assert any right or provision
        under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by either party of any
        breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The
        section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect. The Services
        is operated by us in the United Kingdom.. Those who choose to access the Services from locations outside the
        United Kingdom do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You
        and EcoTradeZone agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will
        not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms
        are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights
        upon any other person or entity.
