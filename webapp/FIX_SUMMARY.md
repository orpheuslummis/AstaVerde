# Webapp Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The webapp was experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error due to incorrect import paths in the reorganized code.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **ABI Import Paths** (config/contracts/index.ts)

**Problem:**

```typescript
// Incorrect - looking in parent directory
import astaverdeAbi from "../AstaVerde.json";
```

**Fixed:**

```typescript
// Correct - looking in config directory
import astaverdeAbi from "../../config/AstaVerde.json";
```

### 2. **Server Status**

- Killed stale dev server processes
- Restarted fresh dev server
- App now loads successfully (200 status)

## ✅ Verification

- **Build:** ✅ Compiles successfully
- **Dev Server:** ✅ Running on http://localhost:3000
- **Page Load:** ✅ Content loads (Market, Eco Assets visible)
- **No Build Errors:** ✅ Clean compilation

## 📝 Lessons Learned

When reorganizing code structure:

1. Always verify import paths are correct
2. Check that JSON/asset files are referenced properly
3. Test the app immediately after changes
4. Kill old dev processes before testing

## 🚀 Current Status

**The webapp is now working correctly!**

- All imports are fixed
- Server responds with 200 status
- Page content loads properly
- Ready for development

Try refreshing your browser at http://localhost:3000 - the app should load correctly now.
